# coding-quiz

This is a fairly simple quiz app that allows you to select an answer, receive feedback on that answer, and then receive a score that you can tag your initials to on a scoreboard. The scoreboard uses Local Storage to maintain the scores on your machine so you may retake the quiz repeatedly to improve your score. Scoring is done by a timer at the top right. The higher the number the timer is at upon finishing, the higher your score is. Keep in mind each question submitted with an incorrect answer drops your time remaining by 10 seconds so choose carefully and quickly!

The app can be viewed and used at this address: https://jkile.github.io/coding-quiz/
